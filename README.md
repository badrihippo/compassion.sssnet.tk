Website to help with rescuing and adopting animals

This website allows people to put up information about animals they have rescued. Other people can then browse this
information if they are looking for a pet to adopt, and the website will help them connect to the rescuer to adopt
the pet. Users can also register themselves as part of "rescue groups", organizations of people involved with rescuing
animals.

This website is being created using [Django](http://djangoproject.com). It is not yet complete.

This website is being designed for [Callisto](http://callisto.sssnet.tk)
by [Cheetaplaza](http://cheetaplaza.sssnet.tk). 
Callisto and Cheetaplaza are both SSS shops. 
For more information about SSS, visit the [website](http://sssnet.tk) or the [wiki](http://smallsharpstones.wikia.com).
